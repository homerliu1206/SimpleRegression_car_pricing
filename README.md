## Predicting MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) 

### Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to predict the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of automobiles based on various factors including Year, Engine Fuel Type, Engine Horsepower (HP), etc. By analyzing the influence and weight of different factors on MSRP prediction, we seek to develop a robust model that can assist in pricing strategy development and classification of cars into different classes.

### Audience
This project would be of interest to stakeholders in the automotive industry, particularly marketing departments and Research & Development (R&D) teams of automobile manufacturers. Marketing departments can utilize the prediction results for devising new pricing strategies, while R&D departments can leverage important features influencing MSRP to differentiate between various classes of cars and guide product development.

### Model Evaluation
The final model achieved a satisfactory performance with an R2 score of 0.728508, indicating that approximately 73% of the variabilities in MSRP can be explained by the model. This performance improvement over previous iterations suggests that the model is reliable for MSRP prediction.

### Next Steps
- Data Collection: Gather new data to further enhance the model's accuracy and predictive capability.
- Model Evaluation: Continuously monitor the model's performance with new data and make necessary adjustments.
- Feature Selection: Experiment with different sets of features to identify the most influential factors in MSRP prediction.
- Model Deployment: Implement the model into a usable form for stakeholders to utilize in pricing strategies and product development.

### Business Recommendations
Based on our findings, we recommend the following to business leadership in the automotive industry:

- Key Influential Factors: Highlight "Year", "Engine HP", "Engine Cylinders", and "Transmission Type" as crucial features influencing MSRP prediction.
- Product Differentiation: Utilize these important features to distinguish between different classes of cars, aiding R&D efforts in product classification and development.
- Pricing Strategy: Incorporate the predictive model into pricing strategies, enabling dynamic pricing adjustments based on market conditions and competitor analysis.
- Competitive Advantage: Leverage the ability to predict MSRP of competitors' products, facilitating proactive adjustments to pricing strategies and maintaining competitiveness in the market.
